  Feature: User can navigate to a specific category
    As a user
    In order to navigate the categories,
    I would like to be able to click on different category buttons.

    Background: 
        Given the following categories exist
            | title     | 
            | Fluffiest | 
            | Angriest  |
        And I am on the landing page

    Scenario: User can navigate different pages by using buttons
        When I click "Fluffiest" button
        Then I should be on "Fluffiest" page
